# Data Science Task 📊

## Overview
This repository contains a data science analysis project developed as a technical task. The main focus is on processing, analyzing, and extracting insights from the provided dataset using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- **`Untitled.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data loading, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- **`informatii_modificate.csv`**: The dataset used for the analysis (contains modified/processed records).
- **`README.pdf`**: Detailed documentation/requirements or the final report of the task.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run the notebook locally, you need Python installed along with the following libraries:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter### How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/GeorgeGrasu/Data-Science-task.git
   2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd Data-Science-task
   3. Start the Jupyter Notebook server:
   jupyter notebook
   4. Open `Untitled.ipynb` to view the analysis and run the cells.

## 📈 Analysis Highlights
The notebook performs the following key operations:
- **Data Loading**: Importing data from `informatii_modificate.csv`.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and data formatting.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing distributions and correlations.
- **Insights**: (Add a specific insight here, e.g., "Identified key trends in the modified information set.")
